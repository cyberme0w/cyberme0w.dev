  terminal</h1>
  <p>Recently I’ve been having issues remembering certain words in German and Portuguese, as I don’t necessarily use
  them on a daily basis. My solution to this problem until now has essentially been:</p>
  <ol type="1">
    <li>try to remember</li>
    <li>struggle</li>
    <li>
      <del>mentally spiral down, feeling like I am loosing any semblance of language-based identity, as well as regret
      for not using my mother-tongues more often</del>
    </li>
    <li>look up the word in an online dictionary</li>
  </ol>
  <p>At some point, having to open a browser, then enter the dictionary’s name, then enter the search term, then wait
  for the page to load, etc, became a bit tedious. So I wrote two short scripts (one for each language) that do all of
  that for me, then spit out the data I am looking for. Of course, there are also offline dictionaries for this kind of
  thing, but then I wouldn’t have a reason to write another post here.</p>
  <p><code>dudencli</code> scrapes <a href="https://duden.de/rechtschreibung" class=
  "uri">https://duden.de/rechtschreibung</a>, the online version of the classic Duden dictionaries. This is specially
  useful to me, because I sometimes forget what gender some less-common words have, as well as their correct spelling.
  The website also provides some other useful data that I don’t really use, such as synonyms, etymology, and
  grammatical notes. Below you can see a short comparison of both the online dictionary as well as
  <code>dudencli</code>’s output:</p>

      <figcaption aria-hidden="true">

      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
      <img src="/media/dudencli-test-cli.png" alt="dudencli‘s results for the search term ’Test’">
      <figcaption aria-hidden="true">
        <code>dudencli</code>‘s results for the search term ’Test’
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  </center>
  <p>Similarly, <code>cliberam</code> uses <a href="https://dicionario.priberam.org/" class=
  "uri">https://dicionario.priberam.org/</a>, a high quality portuguese online dictionary. One thing I would still like
  to add would be an option to fetch the conjugations if available. But until then, this is what the script
  returns:</p>
  <center>
    <figure>
      <img src="/media/cliberam-esparguete-online.png" alt="Priberam’s results for the search term ‘esparguete’">
      <figcaption aria-hidden="true">
        Priberam’s results for the search term ‘esparguete’
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
      <img src="/media/cliberam-esparguete-cli.png" alt="cliberam‘s results for the search term ’esparguete’">
      <figcaption aria-hidden="true">
        <code>cliberam</code>‘s results for the search term ’esparguete’
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  </center>
  <p>This goes without saying, but none of this is sanctioned by either Duden or Priberam, so while I hope they can see
  it for what it is - a project intended to make using their services easier and more accessible, motivated by a
  student’s passion for scripting - I am at the mercy of their lawyers.</p>
  <p>Please don’t sue me (-‿-“)</p>
  <p>As usual, the scripts are available on codeberg (<a href="https://codeberg.org/cyberme0w/dudencli">dudencli</a>,
  <a href="https://codeberg.org/cyberme0w/cliberam">cliberam</a>) under GPLv3, so feel free to steal them (terms and
  conditions apply).</p>
