  <h1 id="openbike">OpenBike</h1>
  <p>For the uninitiated, <a href="https://nextbike.net">nextbike</a> is a bike-sharing company. Clients pay a
  subscription fee and are allowed to rent bikes from multiple stations, with some cities also offering ‚Äòfloating‚Äô
  bikes, which can be rented and returned anywhere within given areas.</p>
  <p>I myself have been a <em>mostly happy</em> customer of nextbike for some time now. In my case, not having to deal
  with maintenance, as well as not using up precious space in my small apartment are great benefits. It also allows me
  to go somewhere by foot and then come back by bike or vice-versa, which is rather convenient.</p>
  <p>I say <em>mostly happy</em>, because while I am happy with the actual service, their mobile (Android) app is
  another story. Briefly pointing out what has been bothering me in no particular order:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The application is closed source (<em>boo!</em>)</li>
    <li>The landing screen seems poorly optimized: a zoomed-out map loads an indecent number of bike markers, which
    cause the entire app to crawl to a halt on older hardware</li>
    <li>The map is filled with e-scooters even though these are not available for rent via the app (basically free ads
    for Tier, who <a href=
    "https://web.archive.org/web/20221209215725/https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/e-scooter-firm-tier-buys-nextbike-bid-expand-offerings-2021-11-15/">
      recently acquired nextbike</a>)
    </li>
    <li>While it‚Äôs possible to filter out e-scooters, <em>you have to do that every single time you open the app</em>,
    after waiting for the app to stop lagging</li>
    <li>There is no way to mark stations as favorite. Sometimes, all I want is to be able to quickly check if one of my
    regular stations has a bike available.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>So - what now?</p>
  <p>After a bit of research, I found an alternative client called <a href=
  "https://f-droid.org/packages/com.example.hochi.nextcompanion/">NextCompanion</a> by <a href=
  "https://github.com/cybre-finn/">cybre-finn</a>. They took some time to reverse engineer nextbike‚Äôs API and published
  <a href="https://github.com/cybre-finn/nextbike-api-reverse-engineering">their results</a> (<em>thanks!</em>).</p>
  <p>NextCompanion calls itself a <em>‚Äúminimalistic client for NextBike‚Äù</em> and well‚Ä¶ it is. With it, you can type
  out a bike‚Äôs number to rent it, and get an overview of your rented bikes - that‚Äôs all. While I‚Äôm sure people on the
  far left end of the minimalism/bloat spectrum will be overjoyed using it, I would prefer to have one or two more
  features.</p>
  <p>Another thing I stumbled upon during my research, was the <em>actual publicly available API documentation</em>‚Ä¶ so
  with that, and inspired by the simplicity of NextCompanion, I decided I‚Äôd write my own app with the following
  features:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>QR-Code scanner to replace manually having to input the bike‚Äôs ID</li>
    <li>Re-triggering an unlock, since sometimes locks get stuck</li>
    <li>Pausing/resuming rentals</li>
    <li>Overview of favorite stations and their bike counts</li>
    <li>Locally stored rental history (to calculate some statistics)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The result is exactly what I want from a mobile application - simple and functional:</p>
  <div style="display: flex;"><img src="/media/open-bike-001-main.png" alt=
  "Preview of the main window of my Android app 'OpenBike'" width="33%"><img src="/media/open-bike-002-qr-scanner.png"
  alt="Preview of the QR code scanner window of my Android app 'OpenBike'" width="33%"><img src=
  "/media/open-bike-003-details.png" alt="Preview of the rental details window of my Android app 'OpenBike'" width=
  "33%"></div>
  <p>Clicking on the (+) icon opens up the QR code scanner, allowing you to quickly scan a bike. Current rentals are
  displayed on the main screen, and you can add certain stations to your ‚Äòbookmarks‚Äô, by clicking on a rental and
  clicking ‚Äòbookmark starting station‚Äô.</p>
  <p>The repository is now public and the first version should pop up in <a href=
  "https://f-droid.org/en/packages/dev.cyberme0w.openbike/">F-Droid</a> shortly. The APK is also available to download
  from the repository‚Äôs <a href="https://codeberg.org/cyberme0w/open-bike/releases">Releases</a> page (although the
  recommended way is via F-Droid].</p>
