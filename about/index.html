  <h2 id="about"><code>&gt; about</code></h2>
  <p>As the title in the header suggest, I go by <code>cyberme0w</code> online. I‚Äôm currently in the process of
  finishing my computer science degree and enjoy working on small side projects. In the interest of making it easier to
  collect all these projects and other stuff I write in a single place, I started working on this website. The fact I
  post about what I do online also <del>pressures</del> motivates me to keep working on things and <em>actually finish
  projects</em>.</p>
  <p>I am pretty passionate about <em>efficient</em> CLI/TUI applications. User interface design peaked when we were
  using green/orange monochrome screens. Pretty much everything nowadays seems to be a mix of</p>
  <p>I firmly believe <em>efficient</em> software design peaked when we were still typing things onto green/orange
  monochrome screens. While I do appreciate that this might not be the ideal interface for <em>every</em> program, I
  consider it to be an essential alternative. Anyone who knows me IRL has probably been on the receiving end of my GUI
  vs.&nbsp;TUI rant at least once. I can‚Äôt promise it won‚Äôt happen again</p>
  <p>The thing is (I‚Äôm working on being less cynical, I promise)‚Äôm working on being less critical of , I promise)
  working on that, Ireceived my usual rant about how graphical applications are inefficient</p>
  <p>and lately I‚Äôve been exploring and experiencing the world of (digital) minimalism. I write in this blog mainly for
  two reasons: - It motivates me to keep working on my side projects (let‚Äôs call it self-imposed peer-pressure), - It
  gives me a platform I control, where I can post My Stuff‚Ñ¢ at will and experiment freely.</p>
  <p>I am currently in the process of finishing my computer science degree. and lately I‚Äôve been exploring (digital)
  minimalism. passionate about (digital) minimalism and <del>paranoid</del> user data privacy</p>
  <p>E-mail is generally the easiest way to reach me. I‚Äôve given a handful of social platforms a try, but have come to
  the conclusion that they usually do more harm than good. You can always reach me at:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><img src="/meat.webp" alt="me at"> cyberme0w <img src="/dotdev.webp" alt="dot dev"></li>
  </ul>
  <p>I might take a day or two to respond, depending on how busy I am at the moment.</p>
  <h2 id="repositories"><code>&gt; repositories</code></h2>
  <p>For anything software related, it‚Äôs usually more appropriate to open an issue in the respective repository. Of
  course, this implies you have an account there. If in doubt, just send an e-mail. In any case, here‚Äôs where you can
  open issues:</p>
