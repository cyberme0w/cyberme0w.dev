  <h2 id="about"><code>&gt; about</code></h2>
  <p>As the title in the header suggest, I go by <code>cyberme0w</code> online. I’m currently in the process of
  finishing my computer science degree and enjoy working on small side projects. In the interest of making it easier to
  collect all these projects and other stuff I write in a single place, I started this website. The fact I post about
  what I do online also <del>pressures</del> <em>motivates</em> me to keep working on things and <em>actually finish
  projects</em>.</p>
  <p>I am pretty passionate about the efficient use of CLI/TUI applications. In my honest opinion, user interface
  design peaked when we were using green/orange monochrome screens and it’s been downhill since then. Anyone who knows
  me IRL has probably been on the receiving end of my GUI/TUI/CLI rant at least once.</p>
  <p>I’m not apologizing.</p>
  <p>Other things I am interested in include but are not limited to: music production, (digital) minimalism,
  user-privacy friendly software, and (of course) free software. That is, free as in freedom <em>and</em> as in
  beer.</p>
  <p>E-mail is generally the easiest way to reach me. I’ve given a handful of social platforms a try, but have come to
  the conclusion that they usually do more harm than good. You can always reach me at:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><img src="/meat.webp" alt="me at"> cyberme0w <img src="/dotdev.webp" alt="dot dev"></li>
  </ul>
  <p>I might take a day or two to respond, depending on how busy I am at the moment.</p>
  <h2 id="repositories"><code>&gt; repositories</code></h2>
  <p>For anything software related, it’s usually more appropriate to open an issue in the respective repository. Of
  course, this implies you have an account there. If in doubt, just send an e-mail. In any case, here’s where you can
  open issues:</p>

  </center>
  <h2 id="support"><code>&gt; support</code></h2>
  <p>I enjoy creating things - writing about them online is my way of pressuring myself into creating more. Should you
  like to support me, I’d be honored to receive a donation through any of the channels listed below:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://liberapay.com/cyberme0w/">Liberapay</a>: for recurring donations - think “Patreon”, but ran by a
      french non-profit
    </li>
  </ul>
