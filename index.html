<h1>Welcome to my humble abode!</h1>
<p>
  Glad to see you found your way to my website.
  I like to write code, produce music and rant about random topics.
  If any of that sounds interesting, grab a cup of tea (or coffee if that's
  your thing (or whiskey if it's that kind of day)) and take a look at some
  of my latest posts.
</p>
<p>
  If you're a returning visitor and enjoy my posts, or would like to let
  something off your chest, feel free to let me know by either
  <a href="mailto:">contacting me</a> or by sending some coffee my way with the
  link below.
</p>
<p>
  Happy reading!
