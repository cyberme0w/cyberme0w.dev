<h1>Welcome to my humble abode!</h1>
<p>Glad to see you found your way to my website.
I like to write code, produce music and rant about random topics.
If any of that sounds interesting, grab a cup of tea (or coffee if that's
your thing (or whiskey if it's that kind of day)) and take a look at some
of my latest posts.</p>
<p>If you're a returning visitor and enjoy my posts, or would like to let
something off your chest, feel free to let me know by either
<a onclick='m();'>contacting me</a> or by sending some coffee my way with the
link below.</p>
<p>Happy reading!</p>
