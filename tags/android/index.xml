For some time now, I&amp;rsquo;ve been annoyed with NextBike&amp;rsquo;s application. I do appreciate the work that went into it, however it seems to be at best a bloated application, and at its worst, amateur hour. From random pop-up toasts like &amp;lsquo;LOL&amp;rsquo;, to the fact that the map crawls to a halt whenever you open it, because there is no way to save your vehicle filter, it is just a pain to use.</description>
