For the uninitiated, NextBike is a bike-sharing company. Users pay a fee and can rent bikes from multiple stations within a city, with some cities offering &amp;lsquo;floating&amp;rsquo; bikes, which can be rented and returned anywhere.
I myself have been a mostly happy customer of NextBike for some time now. In my case, not having to deal with maintenance, as well as not using up precious space in my small appartment are great benefits.</description>
