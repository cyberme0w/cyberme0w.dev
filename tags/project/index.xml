For the uninitiated, NextBike is a bike-sharing company. You can register with them and then simply rent a bike, use it, and return it. They&amp;rsquo;ve been around since 2004 and since then expanded into 20 countries. They were also recently acquired by Tier Mobility, which is famous for their e-scooters.
I myself am a (mostly) happy customer of NextBike and enjoy their service, since for me it means I can freely use their bikes whenever I need, without having to think about maintenance or where to store the bike in my small appartment.</description>
