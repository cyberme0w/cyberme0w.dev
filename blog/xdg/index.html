  <p>Quick; no time for questions! Open a terminal and run:</p>
  <pre><code>ls -A | wc -l</code></pre>
  <p>That’s the number of files, folders and other tidbits that have been placed in your <code>$HOME</code> (with
  <em>or without</em> your blessing). Can you justify that number? Do you even know what is going on there? Personally,
  I like to keep my home as clean as possible, so let’s take a look and try to do a little spring-cleaning.</p>
  <h2 id="a-brief-background-on-xdg">A brief background on XDG</h2>
  <p><code>XDG</code> or “Cross Desktop Group” (previously known as <a href=
  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedesktop.org">X Desktop Group</a>) is an ongoing project with the goal of improving
  UNIX-like operating systems’ interoperability. They have a multitude of software projects and specifications which
  you can find over at <a href="https://freedesktop.org" class="uri">https://freedesktop.org</a>. While their other
  projects are also interesting, the one we’re focused on during this rant is the “<code>XDG</code> Desktop Base
  Directories” specification - <code>basedir</code> for short.</p>
  <p>At ~800 words, <code>basedir</code> is a short document which provides sensible defaults for the storage location
  of user-specific files. It also defines some environment variables that can be set to <em>override</em> the default
  locations. There are seven base directories for the following file types:</p>
  <table>
    <colgroup>
      <col style="width: 35%">
      <col style="width: 29%">
      <col style="width: 34%">
    </colgroup>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th style="text-align: center;">File type</th>
        <th style="text-align: center;">Default value</th>
        <th style="text-align: center;">Environment Variable</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td style="text-align: center;">data files</td>
        <td style="text-align: center;"><code>$HOME/.local/share</code></td>
        <td style="text-align: center;"><code>XDG_DATA_HOME</code> / <code>XDG_DATA_DIRS</code></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td style="text-align: center;">configuration files</td>
        <td style="text-align: center;"><code>$HOME/.config</code></td>
        <td style="text-align: center;"><code>XDG_CONFIG_HOME</code> / <code>XDG_CONFIG_DIRS</code></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td style="text-align: center;">state data</td>
        <td style="text-align: center;"><code>$HOME/.local/state</code></td>
        <td style="text-align: center;"><code>XDG_STATE_HOME</code></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td style="text-align: center;">non-essential (cached) data</td>
        <td style="text-align: center;"><code>$HOME/.cache</code></td>
        <td style="text-align: center;"><code>XDG_CACHE_HOME</code></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td style="text-align: center;">runtime files and other file objects</td>
        <td style="text-align: center;"><em>(no default value)</em></td>
        <td style="text-align: center;"><code>XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</code></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td style="text-align: center;">executable files</td>
        <td style="text-align: center;"><code>$HOME/.local/bin</code></td>
        <td style="text-align: center;"><em>(no environment variable)</em></td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>To put this information into context, let’s say we are writing an application called <code>send-bees</code>. It
  sends bees over TCP/IP to a conveniently preexisting <code>beehive</code>, keeps a record of how many bees were sent
  in a single bee-sending session, as well as the total number of bees sent. It also keeps a log of your activity per
  session.</p>
  <p>If <code>send-bees</code> respects the <code>basedir</code>, it will behave something like this:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Look for the config file with the default amount of bees to send, <code>beehive</code> address, log policy,
    etc. under <code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/send-bees/config</code> (The file name itself is not specified, so anything goes
    here, e.g.&nbsp;<code>send-bees.config</code>).</li>
    <li>Store the total quantity of bees sent in <code>$XDG_STATE_HOME/send-bees/current</code>.</li>
    <li>Open a socket under <code>$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/send-bees/beehive-socket</code> (once again, file names don’t matter
    - folders do)</li>
    <li>cache any bees sent during the current session in <code>$XDG_CACHE_HOME/send-bees/session</code>, which later
    may get dumped to the total bees file</li>
  </ul>
  <p>There are some benefits to this beyond than having things neatly structured. It also seems to be bothering me
  enough - to the point I feel it became rant-worthy. Let’s see what advantages we get from complying with the
  spec:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>config files are all in a single directory</li>
    <li><code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</code> contains only text files and can sensibly be version-controlled with git</li>
    <li>configuring a new device to your liking is as simple as <code>cp -r /backup/.config ~</code> (or <code>git
    clone git@host:user/config .config</code> if you are cool)</li>
    <li>data and state files are in an expected location, as opposed to <strong><em>ｓｏｍｅｗｈｅｒｅ</em></strong>, depending
    on how the developer was feeling that day, and can easily be removed/analyzed/backed up</li>
    <li>your <code>$XDG_CACHE_HOME</code> can be moved to a <a href=
    "https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Tmpfs"><code>tmpfs</code></a>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>What our application should most definitely <em>not do</em>, is to automatically create the
  <code>$HOME/.send-bees/</code> directory and dump everything in there, or perhaps even more perplexing, use
  <code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</code>, implying it complies with <code>basedir</code>, but then <em>dump everything,
  including cache, state, runtime files, etc. into it</em> and call it a day, effectively rendering any kind of version
  controlling ineffective.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, most applications do not follow <code>basedir</code>, or require setting some environment variables
  to look in the right places:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Firefox, as well as any forks (e.g.&nbsp;LibreWolf) insist on creating <code>~/.mozilla/</code></li>
    <li>Thunderbird behaves similarly to Firefox</li>
    <li>Android Studio claims <code>~/.android</code>, even though it allows you to configure what folders it should
    look in</li>
    <li>Dart, Nim, Gradle, and other languages insist in creating their own <code>~/.{language}</code> folders</li>
    <li>Anything Chromium based (that includes every single Electron application) dumps all its files in
    <code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/app/</code></li>
  </ul>
  <p>… <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/XDG_Base_Directory#Hardcoded">and the list goes on</a>.</p>
  <p>Many of these have a workaround, but that’s usually it - a hack. Meaning, every time I install a new piece of
  software, I have to look up if it will fill my <code>~/.config</code> with junk.</p>
  <p>There are tools like <a href="https://github.com/b3nj5m1n/xdg-ninja"><code>xdg-ninja</code></a> which can help in
  cleaning up, but it would be great if more applications simply respected the spec.</p>
