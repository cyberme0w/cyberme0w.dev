<p>For the uninitiated, <a href="https://www.nextbike.net">NextBike</a> is a bike-sharing
company. You can register with them and then simply rent a bike, use it, and
return it. They&rsquo;ve been around since 2004 and since then expanded into 20
countries. They were also recently <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/e-scooter-firm-tier-buys-nextbike-bid-expand-offerings-2021-11-15/">acquired by Tier
Mobility</a>,
which is famous for their e-scooters.</p>
<p>I myself am a (mostly) happy customer of NextBike and enjoy their service,
since for me it means I can freely use their bikes whenever I need, without
having to think about maintenance or where to store the bike in my small
appartment. It also allows me to go somewhere by foot and then come back by
bike, or vice-versa, and in general, it has pushed me more to use my own
muscles to move around, as opposed to taking an over-crowded bus.</p>
<p>I say &ldquo;mostly&rdquo;, because while I am happy with the actual service, their
application is another story. Briefly pointing out what has been bothering
me in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>The applications are closed source.</li>
<li>The main activity is very poorly optimized (zoomed out map filled with
markers).</li>
<li>The map is filled with e-scooters even though these are not bookable via the
app (an obvious free publicity opportunity for Tier).</li>
<li>While you filter out e-scooters, the filter is reset once you restart the app.</li>
<li>There is no way to mark a station as favorite. Sometimes, all I want is to be
able to quickly check if one of my regular stations has a bike.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what to do now? NextBike&rsquo;s API is a DuckDuckGo search away, so surely there
must be another client we can use, right? As usual, the answer is &ldquo;It depends‚Ñ¢&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The alternative client I found is
<a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/com.example.hochi.nextcompanion/">NextCompanion</a>,
by <a href="https://github.com/cybre-finn/">cybre-finn</a>. They also reverse engineered
NextBike&rsquo;s API and published <a href="https://github.com/cybre-finn/nextbike-api-reverse-engineering">their
results</a>.</p>
<p>NextCompanion calls itself <em>&ldquo;a minimalistic client for Nextbike&rdquo;</em> and it keeps
its word. With it, you can type out a bike&rsquo;s number to rent it, and get an
overview of your rented bikes. No more, no less. I am sure people on the more
extreme end of the bloat-minimalism spectrum will be overjoyed using it, but I
would like one or two features more.</p>
<p>Inspired by the simplicity of NextCompanion, I decided to write my own app. I
like boring apps. The more boring an app, the better. It means you will do
whatever you need it for, and then tuck it away again. Due to that, I will be
refraining from adding any unnecessary polish to the app until the following
functions are up and running:</p>
<ul>
<li>QR-Code scanner to replace manually having to input the bike&rsquo;s ID</li>
<li>Re-triggering an unlock, since sometimes locks get stuck</li>
<li>Pausing rentals</li>
<li>See an overview of favorite stations and their bike count</li>
<li>Locally store rentals (rental history + can show interesting statistical data)</li>
</ul>
