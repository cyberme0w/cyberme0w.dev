<p>For the uninitiated, <a href="https://www.nextbike.net">nextbike</a> is a bike-sharing
company. Users pay a fee and can rent bikes from multiple stations within a
city, with some cities offering &lsquo;floating&rsquo; bikes, which can be rented and
returned anywhere.</p>
<p>I myself have been a <em>mostly happy</em> customer of nextbike for some time now. In
my case, not having to deal with maintenance, as well as not using up precious
space in my small apartment are great benefits. It also allows me to go
somewhere by foot and then come back by bike or vice-versa, which is great.</p>
<p>I say <em>mostly happy</em>, because while I am happy with the actual service, their
mobile (Android) app is another story. Briefly pointing out what has been
bothering me in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>The application is closed source <em>(boo!)</em></li>
<li>The landing screen seems poorly optimized: a zoomed-out map loads an indecent
number of bike markers, which cause the entire app to crawl to a halt on
older hardware</li>
<li>The map is filled with e-scooters even though these are not bookable via the
app (basically free ads for Tier, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221209215725/https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/e-scooter-firm-tier-buys-nextbike-bid-expand-offerings-2021-11-15/">recently acquired
nextbike</a>)</li>
<li>While it&rsquo;s possible to filter out e-scooters, <em>you have to do that every
single time you open the app</em>, after waiting for the app to stop lagging</li>
<li>There is no way to mark stations as favorite. Sometimes, all I want is to be
able to quickly check if one of my regular stations has a bike</li>
</ul>
<p>So what to do now?</p>
<p>After a bit of research, I found an alternative client, called
<a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/com.example.hochi.nextcompanion/">NextCompanion</a>,
by <a href="https://github.com/cybre-finn/">cybre-finn</a>. They also took some time to
reverse engineer NextBike&rsquo;s API and published <a href="https://github.com/cybre-finn/nextbike-api-reverse-engineering">their
results</a>
(<em>thanks!</em>).</p>
<p>NextCompanion calls itself <em>&ldquo;a minimalistic client for Nextbike&rdquo;</em> and, well&hellip;
it is. With it, you can type out a bike&rsquo;s number to rent it, and get an
overview of your rented bikes - that&rsquo;s all. While I&rsquo;m sure people on the
far right end of the minimalism/bloat spectrum will be overjoyed using it, I
would prefer to have one or two more features.</p>
<p>Another thing I stumbled upon during my research, was the <em>actual public API
documentation</em>&hellip; so with that, and inspired by the simplicity of
NextCompanion, I decided I&rsquo;d write my own app instead, <del>with blackjack and
hookers!</del> with the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>QR-Code scanner to replace manually having to input the bike&rsquo;s ID</li>
<li>Re-triggering an unlock, since sometimes locks get stuck</li>
<li>Pausing/resuming rentals</li>
<li>Overview of favorite stations and their bike count</li>
<li>Locally store rental history (could be interesting to calculate some
statistics)</li>
</ul>
<p>The repository is now public and the first version should pop up in
<a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/dev.cyberme0w.openbike/">F-Droid</a> shortly. The
APK is also available to download from the repository&rsquo;s
<a href="https://codeberg.org/cyberme0w/open-bike">Releases</a> page.</p>
