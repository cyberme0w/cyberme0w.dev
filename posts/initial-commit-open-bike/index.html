<p>For some time now, I&rsquo;ve been annoyed with NextBike&rsquo;s application. I do
appreciate the work that went into it, however it seems to be at best a bloated
application, and at its worst, amateur hour. From random pop-up toasts like
&lsquo;LOL&rsquo;, to the fact that the map crawls to a halt whenever you open it, because
there is no way to save your vehicle filter, it is just a pain to use. So I
decided to make my own frontend.</p>
<p>Credit should go where credit is due, the effort behind reverse-engineering
NextBike&rsquo;s API goes to <a href="https://github.com/cybre-finn">cybre-finn</a>. They have
published their <a href="https://github.com/cybre-finn/nextbike-api-reverse-engineering">research
results</a> as
well as developed <a href="https://github.com/cybre-finn/next-companion">Next
Companion</a>, which is a minimal
Android client implementation.</p>
<p>Minimal really does mean minimal - the application allows one to sign-in, rent
a bike, and see what bikes are currently active on the account, but that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Personally, I&rsquo;d like to have just a little bit more &lsquo;hmph&rsquo; - for instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>A locally stored history of what rides I took and how long they took</li>
<li>Re-triggering an unlock, since sometimes locks get stuck</li>
<li>A QR-Code scanner, to avoid having to manually type in the bike-ID</li>
<li>A prettier design in general, as the original is quite minimal</li>
</ul>
<p>I am also writting the application in Kotlin instead of the minimal client&rsquo;s
Java, which should be fun to learn.</p>
