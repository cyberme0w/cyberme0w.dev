For some time now, I&amp;rsquo;ve been annoyed with NextBike&amp;rsquo;s application. I do appreciate the work that went into it, however it seems to be at best a bloated application, and at its worst, amateur hour. From random pop-up toasts like &amp;lsquo;LOL&amp;rsquo;, to the fact that the map crawls to a halt whenever you open it, because there is no way to save your vehicle filter, it is just a pain to use.</description>

      <description>Howdy hey Glad to see you found your way to my website! I like to write code, produce music and rant about random topics. If any of that sounds interesting, grab a cup of coffee, tea or whisky (for those special days) and take a look at some of my latest posts below.
If you&amp;rsquo;re a returning visitor and enjoy my posts, or would like to let something off your chest, feel free to let me know by either contacting me or by sending some coffee beans my way via the link in the footer.</description>
